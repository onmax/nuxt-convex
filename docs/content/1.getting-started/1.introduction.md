# Introduction

Nuxt Convex integrates [Convex](https://convex.dev) into your Nuxt application. Convex is a reactive backend that provides real-time data sync, file storage, and serverless functions.

## Features

- **Real-time by default** — Queries auto-update when data changes
- **Virtual modules** — Import from `#convex`, `#convex/api`, and `#convex/storage`
- **Auto-imports** — Composables available without manual imports
- **File storage** — Upload API with auto-scaffolded Convex functions
- **DevTools** — Convex dashboard tab in Nuxt DevTools

## How It Works

Convex functions live in the `convex/` directory at your project root. When you write a query, mutation, or action, Convex generates TypeScript types automatically. The Nuxt module provides Vue composables that wrap these functions with reactive state management.

Your frontend subscribes to queries that update in real-time. When data changes on the server, all connected clients receive updates instantly without polling or manual refetching.

## Requirements

- Nuxt 3.0.0 or higher
- A Convex project (run `npx convex dev` to create one)
