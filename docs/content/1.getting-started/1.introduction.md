description: Learn about Nuxt Convex and its features.

Nuxt Convex integrates [Convex](https://convex.dev) into your Nuxt application. Convex is a reactive backend that provides real-time data sync, file storage, and serverless functions.

## Features

- **Real-time by default** — Queries auto-update when data changes
- **Virtual modules** — Import from `#convex`, `#convex/api`, and `#convex/storage`
- **Auto-imports** — Composables available without manual imports
- **File storage** — Upload API with auto-scaffolded Convex functions
- **DevTools** — Convex dashboard tab in Nuxt DevTools

## How It Works

Convex functions live in the `convex/` directory at your project root. When you write a query, mutation, or action, Convex generates TypeScript types automatically. The Nuxt module provides Vue composables that wrap these functions with reactive state management.

Your frontend subscribes to queries that update in real-time. When data changes on the server, all connected clients receive updates instantly without polling or manual refetching.

## Why nuxt-convex?

There are two community Nuxt modules for Convex. Here's how they compare:

| Feature | nuxt-convex | convex-nuxt |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Auto-imports | :icon{name="lucide:check" .text-green-500} | :icon{name="lucide:x" .text-red-500} |
| `#convex/api` alias | :icon{name="lucide:check" .text-green-500} | :icon{name="lucide:x" .text-red-500} |
| File storage composables | :icon{name="lucide:check" .text-green-500} | :icon{name="lucide:x" .text-red-500} |
| DevTools integration | :icon{name="lucide:check" .text-green-500} | :icon{name="lucide:x" .text-red-500} |
| Nuxt 4 support | :icon{name="lucide:check" .text-green-500} | :icon{name="lucide:x" .text-red-500} |
